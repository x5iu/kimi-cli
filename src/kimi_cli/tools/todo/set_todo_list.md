Update the whole todo list.

Todo list is a simple yet powerful tool to help you get things done. You typically want to use this tool when the given task involves multiple subtasks/milestones, or, multiple tasks are given in a single request. This tool can help you break down the work and track the progress.

This is the only todo list tool available to you. That said, each time you want to operate on the todo list, you need to update the whole. Make sure to maintain the todo items and their statuses properly. Valid statuses are `pending`, `in_progress`, `done`, and `blocked`.

- Use `done_when` to record a short completion criterion when it helps keep the plan grounded.
- Use `executor="background_shell"` for long-running shell work, and `executor="main"` for work done directly.
- The todo list is limited to a maximum of 25 items. If you need more, consolidate smaller steps into higher-level items.

Abusing this tool to track too small steps will just waste your time and make your context messy. For example, here are some cases you should not use this tool:

- When the user just simply ask you a question. E.g. "What language and framework is used in the project?", "What is the best practice for x?"
- When it only takes a few steps/tool calls to complete the task. E.g. "Fix the unit test function 'test_xxx'", "Refactor the function 'xxx' to make it more solid."
- When the user prompt is very specific and the only thing you need to do is brainlessly following the instructions. E.g. "Replace xxx to yyy in the file zzz", "Create a file xxx with content yyy."

However, do not get stuck in a rut. Be flexible. Sometimes, you may try to use todo list at first, then realize the task is too simple and you can simply stop using it; or, sometimes, you may realize the task is complex after a few steps and then you can start using todo list to break it down.
